# Data Wrangling with R

*R for Data Science teaches the whole game. Data Wrangling with R drills the hardest 20%: joins, grouped summaries, messy strings, datetimes, and factors — on one realistic ecommerce dataset.*

## How this differs from R4DS

R4DS surveys the whole data-science workflow; this book drills data preparation
end to end (flat-file/Excel/SPSS/SAS import, dplyr verbs and joins, pipes,
tibbles, strings, datetimes, factors) on a single ecommerce schema. Use it as a
companion drill book after or alongside R4DS.

## Build

Requires R >= 4.1 (native pipe `|>`) and dplyr >= 1.1.0 (`.by`, `slice_*()`),
plus Quarto >= 1.6. Pinned package versions live in `renv.lock`:

```r
renv::restore()             # install pinned package versions
```

```sh
quarto render                # build the book into docs/
Rscript scripts/webr-smoke.R # static check of live {webr-r} cells (<30s)
```
